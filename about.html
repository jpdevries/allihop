        <p>Allihop is a front-end library currently being developed.</p>
        
        <p>It will help you build and style new or existing websites in a way that's clean, accessible and responsive.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Why it was made</h2>
        
        <p>It's easy to lose sight of accessibility when building websites.</p>
        
        <p>Existing code libraries aren't all horrible, but I haven't found a nice one that truly prioritises accessibility. Accessibility is also poorly taught, making it hard to choose and customise the right frameworks, libraries and components.</p>
        
        <p>As an unsurprising result, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-inaccessible-web-how-we-got-into-this-mess-7cd3460b8e32">the web is an inaccessible mess</a>.</p>
        
        <p>I built this library as a by-product of wanting to practice using Sass. I ended up loving Sass and got a bit carried away, therefore... this! I know I'll use the library for my future projects, and I hope you'll use it too.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Guiding principles</h2>
        
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <ul>
                <li>Clean, native HTML is more likely to be widely supported by assistive technologies than custom-made alternatives.</li>
                <li>If a native HTML tag doesn't look nice visually, it won't be used--and this is an accessibility risk.</li>
                <li>Animation should be meaningful, triggered by users, short, and subtle. Animations that are automatic or too bold can be a problem for people with epilepsy, attention disorders, and reading difficulties.</li>
                <li>Focus states are just as--if not more--important than hover states, and should always be obvious.</li>
                <li>Responsive design is a given, but should extend to font size and zoom preferences without breaking the layout.</li>
                <li>If this code library isn't easy to use and integrate, it won't be used.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Room to improve</h2>
        
        <p>Allihop will never be tested with every single assistive technology, nor by every single disabled person. But it's been designed with accessibility as a priority, and it will be tested on a range of technologies before it's released.</p>
        
        <p>That's no guarantee it'll be perfect. If any of the built components aren't accessible to you, please feel free to let me know.</p>
        
        <h2>Behind the name</h2>
        
        <p>The word 'allihop' means 'everyone' or 'all' in Swedish, so I thought it was a great name for a code library with an inclusive goal. I'm currently developing Allihop during my immigration process to Sweden, hence the Swedish influence. </p>
